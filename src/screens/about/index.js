            Cebarco (Civil Engineering, Building and Construction) was founded in 1992 by Khalid Abdulrahim.
            We form the focal point of the KAR Group and provide our clients with unparalleled managerial, technical and
            engineering services. As a Grade AA contractor (certified by the Bahrain Ministry of Work, Municipalities Affairs &
            Urban Planning), Cebarco is considered to be part of the local construction elite. Clients can take comfort in our
            commitment to the quality, health, safety and environmental issues surrounding all of our projects.

            As Bahrain has grown into a thriving 21st century economy, Cebarco has grown with it,
            taking on some of the nation's biggest projects along the way. These include the Bahrain International Circuit,
            City Centre Bahrain, Isa Cultural Centre and New Exhibition & Convention Centre. Completing the racing circuit in
            just 16 months (6 weeks ahead of schedule) paved the way for Bahrain's first ever Formula One grand prix in 2004
            and established Cebarco's reputation for building world class motorsports venues. This led to us being awarded
            contracts for both the Bahrain International Karting Circuit and the Yas Marina Circuit.

            Cebarco has a wealth of expertise encompassing most forms of hotels, commercial, retail, sports facilities, military,
            and residential building construction as well as significant infrastructure projects such as data centres, roads,
            bridges, substations, and sewage treatment plants. Our headquarters is in the Kingdom of Bahrain with operations
            also in Cyprus and the UAE.

                We see every challenge as an opportunity to serve as an advocate for our clients, completing even the
                toughest projects. In good times and bad, we work hard to become partners with our clients and understand
                their businesses. That knowledge helps us keep costs low whilst maintaining high standards.
                It also allows us to think outside of the box and make suggestions they may not have considered before.
